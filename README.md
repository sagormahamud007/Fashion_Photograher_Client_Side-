# Live-Site : https://wedding-photographer-1bcb6.web.app/


* First, I install all the project's recommendations, then finish the route definition, and then bring a header from bootstrap to the home page and show it in the navbar.

* Then sign in and login to login and sign in Design the form, then go to Firebase and install Firebase, then open the project in Firebase and complete the login and sign-in authentication.

* Then on the home page a slider shows some images with it, then I go to the server site where the server is running on 5000 prot, after starting the server I connect to the mongdb database.

* I put 6 services in that MongDB, then from the server site, from that database, through the server site, I brought all the data and showed it on the client site, first on the home page, I showed 3 through the limit on the server site.

* Then show 6 data on the service page, then put the user data in MongDB and bring that data and show it on my review page, there is a block section where there are 4 questions, the user is allowed to order on my service page etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
